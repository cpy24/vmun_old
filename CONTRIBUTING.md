# Contributing

This project is not open for collaboration. This project will serve as my senior project for college application and I prefer to keep everything to myself.


Here are alternatives that you can do:
* If you have problems, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/crimsonpython24-grade10/vmun/issues) here.
* If you have code to add, please [open a pull request](https://github.com/crimsonpython24-grade10/vmun/pulls) here. 
* If you have something to ask me, please [send me an email](mailto:16064@hcas.com.tw) but don't spam it since I'm not dumb enough to use my personal but school address.
